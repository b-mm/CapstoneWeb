            <p>The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application designed to help security
                professionals and developers learn about web vulnerabilities. DVWA contains several categories of
                real-world vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. It offers different security levels to
                practice exploiting and securing these issues. This makes it ideal for practicing penetration testing in
                a safe environment.</p>
